These are designed to be custom nodes i found usefulness to that hopefully others can share. 

## Empty Latent creation by desired size with scale

This node is for knowing the desired output images sizes and reverse engineering based on what SDXL supports. It will them output:
1. a blank Latent
2. the Width & Height of generated Latent
3. The CLIP Width & Height based on the input scale
4. a ratio for your Upscaler. 

This is all based on this repo: https://github.com/marhensa/sdxl-recommended-res-calc who created a great tool and I just enhanced it for my needs.
